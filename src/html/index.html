            <p>Expand the way you learn about Temporal with these browser-based inspection and interaction services. These services extend beyond the standard Temporal Server Web UI to support learning and engagement. Crafted specifically for tutorial use, they enable you to explore developer features in a safe and transparent environment. You can run these locally using 'localhost' (127.0.0.1), or host them on your favorite sites or droplets.</p>

                        <h2>Message Display</h2>
                        <p>A simple billboard display that updates its Markdown-based content using remote API calls. Perfect for exploring scheduled tasks or providing insight into Workflow state.</p>

                        <h2>Action Log</h2>
                        <p>An API-controlled log, with the newest updates always at the top. Create output external to your Workflows to track information you wouldn't normally see in the Web UI or want to query, such as Activity Retries.</p>

                        <p>Explore how you add human intervention for a Workflow to proceed. This microservice provides a friendly button along with a prompt you set. It can't succeed without direct human interaction.</p>

                        <p>This microservice uses a text entry field with a prompt you set plus a submit/cancel button pair.</p>

                        <h2>Unreliable Microservice</h2>
                        <p>Tunes a microserve so its reliability ranges from 0.0 (always fails) to 1.0 (always succeeds). Learn to build activity retry policies using an endpoint whose characteristics you control. Built around Error 418 ("I'm a teapot") so this is the "coffee" service.</p>

                        <p>Explore how a process moves forward by calling an n-stage chain of microservice activities. You set the base chain length, the delay timing, and update the progress using API calls. An AJAX-driven Mermaid-based graphic shows the progression of your Workflow through the chain as each Activity enters, retries, and succeeds.</p>

                        <p>Similar to the Message Display Service, this service offers a stylized look with the same endpoint behavior. It's to be used with the signals, queries, and schedules samples and has a built-in "mantra" set of daily aphorisms.</p>
